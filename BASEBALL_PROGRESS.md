## 28. Append-only evidence store boundary — 2026-09-15

Added `src/quantbot/baseball/evidence_store.py` as the first persistence boundary.

Implemented:

- append-only in-memory storage for validated odds observations and pick events;
- idempotent exact duplicate handling;
- fail-closed conflict handling by immutable observation/pick identity;
- deterministic retrieval ordering;
- batch observation append support;
- basic store statistics.

Added `tests/test_evidence_store.py` covering exact duplicates, conflicting duplicates, and deterministic ordering.

This is intentionally storage-agnostic and does not yet claim durable persistence. A database adapter will be added only after the contract and conflict semantics are stabilized.

Commits:

- `c1f5bce` — add append-only evidence store boundary;
- `88b949f` — verify append-only evidence store semantics.

Runtime tests were not independently executed in this environment.
